## Dependencies
  - pyperclip to be added

## ToDo

  - Add flags to execute local file XML location from command line instead of editing .py file
  - Add back in pyperclip so URL gets copied to clipboard
  
## Notes

  - Script generates a cleaner clash set label w/o the "_". Added for github readme compatability.
